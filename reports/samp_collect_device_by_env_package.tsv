	The collection of soil samples has be done alongside the national roads of the country on approximately 50 km intervals. Prior to sampling, a digital camera and a GPS have been used for photographs and record of geographical positions, respectively . Vegetation and big particles on the top soil surface were then removed before the sampling of 4x100 g of soil from each sampling site. Labelled soils were stored in different ziplock bags and put in a cooler box for transportation to the laboratory.	44

water	The water for the metagenomes was collected from below the boundary layer (in crevices and against the benthos) to avoid confounding problems with the water column. The sampling was conducted at the same time of day to help minimize diurnal effects. The water was collected from over ~20 m2 of reef using a modified bilge pump connected to low density polyethylene (LDPE) collapsible bags (19 l; Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL; Figure S1). 1) A large fraction containing mostly microbes, some small eukaryotes (such as dinoflagellates and protists), and a few VLPs, and 2) a small fraction containing mostly VLPs and some small microbes. To obtain these fractions the seawater was processed through a series of filters. The large eukaryotes were removed by filtering the entire sample through 100 m Nitex, into a barrel lined with a clean, high-density polyethylene bag. The filtrate was then concentrated to ~500 ml on a 100 kDa tangential flow filter (TFF), which captured the unicellular eukaryotes, microbes and VLPs (i.e., the water was removed). During the filtration, pressures were kept below 0.6 bar (10 psi) to ensure that the viruses were not destroyed. The concentrated sample was then passed through 0.45 m Sterivex filters (Millipore, Inc) using a 50 ml syringe. In this step, the large metagenomic fraction consisting of microbial cells was caught on the filter (microbiomes) and the filtrate was the small metagenomic fraction (viromes). All filtrations were performed on the research vessel, and the samples were stored for further processing in the laboratory at SDSU. The Sterivex filters were frozen at −80C. The 0.45 m filtrates (i.e., the virome) were extracted with chloroform to kill any residual cells (10% vol:vol; most viruses are resistant to chloroform) and stored at 4C.	6

A 1% (w/v) homogenized composting sample was used to inoculate minimal medium (MM). Cultures were supplemented with 3% (w/v) Sugarcane Bagasse (SCB) and incubated at 30 ¡C with 150 rpm agitation for up to five weeks. Prior to use, SCB was washed and dried at 50 ¡C. Weekly sampling was performed on three biological replicates. SCB and microbial biomass were separated from culture supernatant by centrifugation at 3,000 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature and used for nucleic acid extraction and biomass analysis.	5

	P. micropora cells were harvested by low-speed centrifugation (500 x g, 2 minutes) at 4 degrees C. The harvested cells were passed through miracloth (Merk Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) and 20 micrometer mesh-filter (HD-20, Nippon Rikagaku kikai co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) to eliminate contaminating bacteria that were enriched in the dead P. micropora cell aggregates larger than 20 micrometer, and followed by the washing with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0) three times, and with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0) plus 10 mM EDTA six times. Next, to remove the cell debris smaller than 5 micrometer, the cells were trapped on 5 micrometer mesh-filter (PP-5n, Kyoshin Rikoh Inc, Tokyo, Japan) and washed with 5 ml TE buffer.

	Guano was scooped into a sterile 15mL conical using a sterile scoop and fresh gloves	2
water	250 l of seawater were collected by using Niskin bottles mounted on a General Oceanics rosette from a depth of 3,010 m (sea-bottom at 3,243 m depth) at the Ionian Km3 station November 17th 2004 during a cruise of the R/V Urania. Seawater was sequentially filtered through a 5 m pore size polycarbonate filter and the filtrate passed through 0.22 m pore size Sterivex filters (Durapore, Millipore) using a peristaltic pumping system. Sterivex filters were filled with lysis buffer (40 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris/ HCl, 0.75M sucrose) and stored at −20C, until DNA extraction.	2

water	The water for the metagenomes was collected from below the boundary layer (in crevices and against the benthos) to avoid confounding problems with the water column. The sampling was conducted at the same time of day to help minimize diurnal effects. The water was collected from over ~20 m2 of reef using a modified bilge pump connected to low density polyethylene (LDPE) collapsible bags (19 l; Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL; Figure S1). 1) A large fraction containing mostly microbes, some small eukaryotes (such as dinoflagellates and protists), and a few VLPs, and 2) a small fraction containing mostly VLPs and some small microbes. To obtain these fractions the seawater was processed through a series of filters. The large eukaryotes were removed by filtering the entire sample through 100 m Nitex, into a barrel lined with a clean, high-density polyethylene bag. The filtrate was then concentrated to ~500 ml on a 100 kDa tangential flow filter (TFF), which captured the unicellular eukaryotes, microbes and VLPs (i.e., the water was removed). During the filtration, pressures were kept below 0.6 bar (10 psi) to ensure that the viruses were not destroyed. The concentrated sample was then passed through 0.45 m Sterivex filters (Millipore, Inc) using a 50 ml syringe. In this step, the large metagenomic fraction consisting of microbial cells was caught on the filter (microbiomes) and the filtrate was the small metagenomic fraction (viromes). All filtrations were performed on the research vessel, and the samples were stored for further processing in the laboratory at SDSU. The Sterivex filters were frozen at −80C. The 0.45 m filtrates (i.e., the virome) were extracted with chloroform to kill any residual cells (10% vol:vol; most viruses are resistant to chloroform) and stored at 4C. The viruses in the small metagenomic fractions (i.e., 0.45 m filtrate treated with chloroform) were purified using cesium chloride (CsCl) step gradients to remove free DNA and any cellular material [29], [30]. Viral DNA was isolated using CTAB/phenol:chloroform extractions and amplified in six to eight 18-hour Genomiphi reactions. These reactions were pooled and purified using silica columns (Qiagen Inc, Valencia, CA). The DNA was then precipitated with ethanol and re-suspended in water at a concentration of approximately 300 ng l−1.	1

	The collected samples were transported in sterile polyethylene bags that were maintained at 4 oC.	1
	The collection of soil samples has be done alongside the national roads of the country on approximately 50 km intervals. Prior to sampling, a digital camera and a GPS have been used for photographs and record of geographical positions, respectively . Vegetation and big particles on the top soil surface were then removed before the sampling of 100 g of soil from each sampling site. Labelled soils were stored in different ziplock bags and put in a cooler box for transportation to the laboratory.	1
	The collection of soil samples has been done using the national roads of the country. Sampling sites was based on approximately 50 km intervals. Sampling campaigns took into account the biome composition in each nation ensuring, where possible, that all biomes or agro-ecological zones are roughly equally represented. At each sampling site four separate samples are recovered. Each sample, approximately 100g from 0 to 5cm surface soil, in a separate labelled bag is a composite of four pseudoreplicate subsamples collected within a 1m2 virtual quadrat	1
	The flowers were taken before harvest was over. Most of the flowers opened the afternoon before and were all visited by insects.	1
	The sample was collected from a rumen-cannulated cow.	1
	The samples were placed in sterilized polyethylene bags containing seawater and immediately transported to the Center of Marine Biologyof São Paulo University (CEBIMar).	1
	The sampling in the mine was carried out after consultation and with assistance of the mine geologists. The pieces of rock samples were taken from the salt mine, immediately put into sterile polyethylene bags, and transported to the laboratory.	1
	The soil is stored in a -80 degree refrigerator	1
