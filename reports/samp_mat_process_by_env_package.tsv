	DNA extraction. Individual ticks were rinsed in 70% ethanol, air dried, and homogenized using a TissueLyzer II (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) in 2 ml deep-well 96-well plates at 25 Hz for 2 x 3 minutes. Each well contained a 5 ml steel bead (Qiagen) and 50 ?l genomic digestion buffer (PureLink Pro 96 kit). DNA was extracted with Invitrogen’s PureLink Pro 96 kit (Fisher Scientific, Suwanee, GA) per manufacturer’s protocol and eluted in 70 ?l elution buffer. Proteinase K digestion was performed overnight. DNA was quantified on a Qubit 2.0 (Life Technologies) using High Sensitivity DNA Kit. Samples containing sufficient DNA were sent for high throughput sequencing. A total of 1081 ticks were sequenced, of which there were 857 nymphs and 224 adults. High throughput sequencing. Target regions of 31 bacterial and one protozoal gene wereamplified using the primer sets in Table S4 and sequenced using Illumina® HiSeq Rapid sequencing kit version 2 on a HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina®, San Diego, CA, USA) at the W. M. Keck Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as described previously (Muturi et al., 2016; doi:10.1186/s13071-016-1299-6). Briefly, sample DNA was amplified on the Fluidigm® microfluidics PCR platform with appropriate linkers and sample barcodes. The final Fluidigm® products were pooled in equimolar ratio for sequencing and spiked with 10% non-indexed PhiX control library (Illumina®) and sequenced by 2 x 250 nt paired-end sequencing on the Illumina® HiSeq® Rapid system. Fastq files were generated with the bcl2fastq v2.17.1.14 Conversion Software (Illumina®).

	Total RNA, including viral RNA, was extracted using RNA PowerSoilTM Total RNA Isolation kit (MO-BIO Laboratories, Inc., CA, USA) according to the manufacturerŐs instructions, but with minor modifications. Briefly, 2.0 g of each of the sediment samples was homogenized by vigorously vortexing in a tube containing silica carbide beads, kit buffers and phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (pH 6.5-8.0) (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., MO,USA). After centrifugation, sample supernatants were mixed with equal volumes of chloroform and subjected to two chloroform (Sigma-Aldrich Inc., MO,USA) extractions, followed by sample precipitation and resuspension in designated buffers. Samples were loaded into the flow column to undergo final elution and precipitation. The sample pellets were resuspended in 30 ml of RNase-free water and stored at -80ĄC. RNA extracts were processed and sequenced by Fusion Genomics Corp. (Burnaby, BC) using their Avian Influenza Environmental ONETestTM assay. In brief, RNA samples were pretreated to remove additional inhibitors and other elements known to compromise RNA library construction. Cleaned samples were processed into dual indexed Illumina compatible libraries. Libraries were then enriched for AIV using an in-house liquid phase hybridization and capture protocol and Fusion Genomics' Quantum Probes. Enriched libraries then were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 according to manufacturerŐs instructions.	345

	Excerpt from PMID 27015005: Peat soil microcosms were set up by mixing 30 g of fresh soil (10-20 cm depth) with 60 ml of filter-sterilized (0.2 μm) and anoxic peat water in 250 ml sterile glass bottles. Microcosms were sealed under 100 % N₂ with butyl rubber septa and incubated for 53 days in the dark at 14 °C. Microcosms were periodically amended from the first day of incubation with formate, acetate, propionate, lactate, or butyrate, or incubated without any external substrate. Half of the substrate-amended and -unamended microcosms additionally received periodic amendments of sulfate. These microcosms were initially spiked with sulfate, and, thereafter, were periodically amended with small amounts of sulfate. Triplicate microcosms were set up per incubation condition (36 microcosms in total).	181

	Liquid-based cytology (LBC) specimens were obtained from 20 patients with enrolled in a Phase II clinical trial of an HPV therapeutic vaccine (NCT02481414). In order to be eligible, participants had to have high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) or cannot rule out HSILs in cervical cytology or CIN2/3 in cervical biopsy. Those who qualified for the study based on their cervical cytology underwent cervical biopsy, and they qualified for vaccination if the results were CIN2/3. The cervical cytology specimens in this current study were collected before the vaccination and reserved in the vial of the ThinPrep Pap Test (HOLOGIC) as per Ravilla et al. 2019 (doi:10.1177/1534735419893063). The storage period from sample collection to DNA extraction was 716 ± 105 days. Each LBC sample was dispensed into four separate 2 mL sterile collection tubes (dispensed sample volume = 500 μL). DNA was extracted from each specimen using one of four commercially available kits: ZymoBIOMICS DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, D4300), QIAamp PowerFecal Pro DNA Kit (QIAGEN, 51804), QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, 51304), and IndiSpin Pathogen Kit (Indical Bioscience, SPS4104). Applied sample volume of ThinPrep solution was 300 μL for Zymo , 300 μL for PowerFecal Pro, and 200 μL for QIAamp Mini, and 300 μL for IndiSpin. DNA yield for each method was evaluated by spectrophotometer (Nanodrop One, Thermo Scientific). Positive control was mock vaginal microbial communities composed of a mixture of genomic DNA from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC MSA1007). Negative control was the ThinPrep preservation solution as blank extraction (doi: 10.1186/s40168-017-0267-5). Controls and the extracted DNA were sent to Argonne National Laboratory (IL, USA) for amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Paired-end reads from libraries with 250-bp inserts were generated for the V4 region using the barcoded primer set: 515FB: 5'-GTGYCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3' and 806RB: 5'-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT-3' (dois: 10.1038/nature24621, 10.3354/ame01753, 10.1111/1462-2920.13023, /10.1128/mSystems.00009-15, (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-standards/16s/).

	100 g of soil were sampled with a core sampler from 12 points of the plot, mixed thoroughly, sieved to 2 mm and stored on dry ice in the field. DNA was later extracted from soil by use of the NucleoSpin Soil Kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany). A 16S library was produced using the the primers S-D-Bact-0008-a-S-16 (5?-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC-3?) and S-D-Bact-0343-a-A-15 (5'-CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3'). PCRs were carried out in triplicate using the NEBNext High-Fidelity 2X PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, US-MA) with 10 ng input DNA. 10 ng of amplified DNA per sample were indexed using the Nextera XT Index Kit v2 (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, US-CA) for multiplexed short-read sequencing. The resulting amplicons were diluted to 4 nM and pooled equimolar for sequencing on a MiSeq System (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, US-CA).	80

	Amplicon libraries of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were prepared following procedures outlined by Kozich et al. (2013), using dual indexed primers (515F and 806R). Amplicons were normalized using SequalPrep plate normalization kit (Invitrogen), product was pooled to equimolar concentrations, and pooled amplicons were cleaned with AmpureXP magnetic beads . Paired-end sequencing was performed at Michigan State University’s RTSF Genomics Core using an Illumina MiSeq with a maximum read length of 250 base pairs on MiSeq v2 reagent cartridge (Illumina Inc.). Illumina Real Time Analysis v1.18.54 was used to perform base calling, and the resulting output was demultiplexed and converted to FastQ format with Illumina Bcl2fastq v2.19.1.	52

	Samples were kept in 96% ethanol at room temperature until reaching the biotechnology laboratory in Quito where they were kept at -20 degrees Celsius until DNA was extracted using a modified version of the QIAamp DNA Stool mini kit. We used five primers developed by Nievergelt and collaborators (1998) for Callithrix jacchus (CJ1, CJ7, CJ11, CJ14, and CJ15). PCR amplification was performed following the method standardized by Nieto and collaborators (2010). Annealing temperature varied according to the primer. Genotypic information for each sample at each locus was collected from the polyacrylamide gel. The size of alleles was determined using a regression equation constructed with the band migration distances of Invitrogen 10bp DNA ladder. Bands that were within the size range established by Nievergelt and collaborators (1998) and Nieto and collaborators (2010), or in the proximity, were considered alleles and were included in the analyses.	28

	Fecal samples less than 6 hr old were collected from individual mice and stored at -80C (doi:10.1186/s12866-018-1359-5). DNA extraction was performed using ZymoBiomics DNA Miniprep kit (#D4300; Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, samples were suspended in lysis buffer and heated to 60 °C for 20 min prior to 20 min of horizontal vortexing with beads to homogenize the samples. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant collected. From this several processing steps were performed to remove residual protein and the final DNA sample was eluted in 100 μL of nuclease-free H2O. The concentration and purity was determined by the A260/A280 value (Cytation 5; BioTek, Winooski VT, USA). The extracted sample DNA was sent to the ZymoBIOMICS® Targeted Sequencing Service for Microbiome Analysis (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and sequenced using the Qucik-16S™ Primer set V3-V4 (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) via the Illumina MiSeq v3 reagent kit using a 10% PhiX spike-in. Summary of the sequencing service: PCR products were quantified with qPCR fluorescence readings and pooled together based on equal molarity. The pooled library was cleaned using the Select-a-Size DNA Clean & Concentrator™ (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA), then quantified with TapeStation Santa Clara, CA) (Agilent Technologies, (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA).	26

	All spiders used for complementary DNA (cDNA) library construction were first anesthetized using CO2, frozen at -80°C for 10 min, and then dissected at 4°C. To access the venom gland, the chelicerae were first removed from the base of the structure (towards the carapace). Once separated, each chelicera was individually cut from the ventral side up to the base of the fang in order to approach the venom gland from underneath. The cheliceral muscle that surrounds the venom gland was detached to expose the isolated venom gland. Dissected venom glands were placed immediately in TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) to be processed.	3

	After sampling, cells were pelleted and frozen at -80C until DNA extraction. For DNA extraction, cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in phosphate buffer (MP Biomedicals) + detergent (MT buffer, MP Biomedicals), and lysed via bead beating. DNA was extracted from the aqueous phase of the lysate via phenol:chloroform:isoamyl -alcohol extraction. Extracted DNA was concentrated using the Clean and Concentrator-5 kit (Zymo Technologies) and frozen at -80C. An aliquot of the extracted DNA was used to prepare a DNA sequencing library following the TrueSeq library (Illumina) protocol.	3

	Total RNA (200 ng) purified from pooled groups of larvae and pupae was used for mRNA purification with the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit (Catalog # RS-122-2101). The low sample protocol was followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The RNA fragmentation step was omitted according to the protocol in appendix A to maximize library insert length. Rather than fragmenting the RNA, the sealed plate was incubated at 80oC for 2 minutes to elute the primed mRNA from the RNA purification beads. This omission resulted in RNA fragmentation with an average final library size of 467 bp. Library sizes were determined empirically by microfluidic analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and quantified using the Quant-iT dsDNA kit with broad range standards (ThermoFisher Scientific, Q-33130). Samples were pooled together at equimolar quantities and sequenced twice using the Illumina MiSeq (2x300) cycle kit with version 3 chemistry. Using the Illumina indices, the data were demultiplexed and the runs combined to assign the data to individual samples. All other procedures were followed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	2

	Collected samples were plated on blood agar/Luria bertani agar filled with carbapenem/colistin discs to inhibit the growth of colistin susceptible and carbapenem-sensitive isolates. The putatively resistant isolates were then further analysed with a MicroScan to determine their species identity and antimicrobial sensitivity results. Broth microdilution was used to confirm colistin's sensitivity. The DNA of isolates was isolated and screened with PCR to confirm the presence of known carbapenemases and colistin resistance genes.	2

	A 0.3-0.9 L surface seawater for RNA analysis was filtered onto a 5-micrometer pore size (47mm diameter) polycarbonate membrane using a hand vacuum pump under low vacuum pressure. The filtration was completed within five minutes in order to capture the in situ gene expression profiles. The membrane was immersed in 1 mL TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and kept on ice until transport to the laboratory where the samples were kept at -80 Celsius until RNA extraction.	1
	A pipettable slurry (0.2 g dryweight) per milliliter was mixed with anoxic bicarbonate-buffered and hepes-buffered mineral salts medium. Please see Justicia-Leon et al. (2012) for further details.	1

	The DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used without addition of any biological material according the manual. A further 1 min centrifugation step at 20,000g was added after the final washing. DNA was quantified on a Multiskan GO (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The primers 784F (5-TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGAGGATTAGATACCCTGGTA-3) and 1061R (5-GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCRRCACGAGCTGACGAC-3) (Andersson et al. 2008) with Illumina over-hang adaptor sequences (underlined above) were used to amplify the variable region 5 and 6 of the 16SrRNA gene. Amplifications were performed in triplicates and adjusted to a total volume of 20 L containing 10 L PCR multiplex mix (Qiagen multiplex PCR kit), 0.5 M of each primer, 1 L template DNA containing 10 - 80 ng DNA, and H2O. PCRs were set to an initial denaturation at 95C for 15 min followed by 27 cycles each with 30s at 95C, 90s at 55C, and 30s at 72C. The final elongation was set at 72C for 10 min. Successful amplifications were confirmed using 10 l PCR products on a 2% agarose gel and triplicate PCRs were pooled for each sample. Samples were then sent to the Centre for PanorOmic Sciences (CPOS), The University of Hong Kong, for library preparation, bead clean-up, pooling in equimolar ratios and sequencing on a MiSeq Nano v2 PE250 run with 20% PHiX.	1

	Methods will be published in Buser-Young, J, et al., Hidden processes during seasonal isolation of a high-altitude watershed. Submitted to Frontiers in Earth Sciences, Feb 2021. They are briefly described here. Step 1: A Biological OsmoSampler was placed in the river with tubing inlet sampling the river water column (sensu Robidart et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2015). Step 2: Recover the Biological OsmoSampler 3 months later. Step 3: Section tubing into two ~7 m long increments and expel contents using a syringe. Step 4: Filter contents onto PES, dissolve using phenol chloroform, and extract DNA per manufacturer's instruction (Zymo Research). Step 5: amplify DNA using Earth Microbiome Protocol, sequence amplicons using Illumina MiSeq paired-end sequencing.	1

	HWLR27 was isolated from Salix fragilis (Crack willow) infected with willow leaf rust (Melampsora epitea). The willow leaf rust pustule had a small green growth on it and this was isolated to be a HWLR27 spore (haploid). Then the mycelium and spore tissue was lysed from potato dextrose agar under liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle. DNA was isolated using the PowerSoil DNA isolation kit (Mo Bio). Library preparation was completed using the Illumina TruSeq PCR-free kit, 350 bp insert, HiSeq v4 chemistry and 2x 125 bp Paired-end reads. An Illumina HiSeq 2500 was used for sequencing.	1

	Dissected guts were rinsed in sterile PBS and whole springtails were rinsed three times in sterile water before processing. After the washing steps, DNA was directly isolated from two of the samples (Fc3 and Fc4) while additional steps were applied to prepare samples Fc1 and Fc2. For these two samples, we separated bacterial cells from F. candida s cells by using the method described, with modifications Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2012;109(27). The samples were crushed in PBS in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, using a plastic pestle. The samples were then gently vortexed, to encourage separation of cells, before being passed through 20 um and 8 um filters in succession. The filtered samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 30 min to harvest cells, and the pellet was resuspended in 200 ul TE buffer. For sample Fc2, an additional step with a density gradient was applied. An 80 percent Percoll solution in 0.15 mol l -1 NaCl was prepared. 1 ml of this solution was placed in a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube and spun at 20 000 g for 20 min to create a gradient. The 200 ul of TE buffer containing the cells was gently placed on top of the gradient, and the tube was centrifuged at 400 g for 20 min.

	Samples were kept in 96% ethanol at room temperature until reaching the biotechnology laboratory in Quito where they were kept at -20 degrees Celsius until DNA was extracted using a modified version of the QIAamp DNA Stool mini kit.We used five primers developed by Nievergelt and collaborators (1998) for Callithrix jacchus (CJ1, CJ7, CJ11, CJ14, and CJ15). PCR amplification was performed following the method standardized by Nieto and collaborators (2010). Annealing temperature varied according to the primer. Genotypic information for each sample at each locus was collected from the polyacrylamide gel. The size of alleles was determined using a regression equation constructed with the band migration distances of Invitrogen 10bp DNA ladder. Bands that were within the size range established by Nievergelt and collaborators (1998) and Nieto and collaborators (2010), or in the close proximity, were considered alleles and were included in the analyses.	1

	Sample was taken before the morning feeding in 5 different rumen sites, pooled equally and mixed thoroughly to obtain a representative sample of the rumen content. A subsample was stored with RNAlater to avoid RNA degradation. Total RNA was extracted in triplicate from 400 mg of centrifuged rumen content using Trizol. Briefly, sample was homogenized with 100 mg of 0.1 mm zirconia beads and 1.2 mL of Trizol. Subsequent steps were followed as recommended by the manufacturer. RNA precipitation was performed using a mix of isopropanol and a saline solution containing NaCl 1.2 M and disodium citrate 0.8 M. Total RNA were then subjected to DNase treatment. Triplicates of total RNA were pooled. Total RNA was then subjected to mRNA enrichment. A library was prepared with 1ug of mRNA-enriched RNA by Illumina TruSeq mRNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The library was quantified using qPCR according to the qPCR Quantification Protocol Guide (KAPA Library Quantificatoin kits for Illumina Sequecing platforms) and qualified using the 2100 Bioanalyzer. Indexed library was then sequenced using the MiSeq platform (Illumina,San Diego, USA).	1

	All spiders used for complementary DNA (cDNA) library construction were first anesthetized using CO2, frozen at â€“80Â°C for 10 min, and then dissected at 4Â°C. To access the venom gland, the chelicerae were first removed from the base of the structure (towards the carapace). Once separated, each chelicera was individually cut from the ventral side up to the base of the fang in order to approach the venom gland from underneath. The cheliceral muscle that surrounds the venom gland was detached to expose the isolated venom gland. Dissected venom glands were placed immediately in TRIzolÂ® reagent (Invitrogen) to be processed.	1

	After retrieving, the overlying sea water of mini core was gently extracted and replaced with sterile oxic sea water (SOSW) and then cold incubated in the dark to allow oxygen consumption and gliding of mat forming cells in the overlaying-sea water. Gliding filamentous mat-forming cells were gently aspirated with a disposable Pasteur pipette, and then transferred to 100 ml polypropylene flasks filled with SOSW. Filaments were gently dispersed by pipetting followed by flushing with SOSW. Samples were then incubated for 3 hours to allow for the decantation of filaments and chemotactic self-aggregation. Mat biomass collected from 9 mini-cores at the study site were segregated into two subsamples for independent downstream processing. The Clean mat biomass was obtained by three times dispersion in fresh SOSW followed by cell self-aggregations steps. This process was intended to reduce the carry over of sediment particles, flora not attached to the gliding filamentous cells and observed polychaetes and oligochaetes that could saturate the Eukarya library. Total DNA was extracted using a Power Soil DNA isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications.	1

	Soils were brought to the lab, air dried, sieved to 2 mm then stored in a 3.7 L gallon mason jar at room temperature. Three months after collection, 200 g of soil were added to a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask with an air headspace and sealed with a large rubber stopper secured with electrical tape. The flask was amended with 0.1 ml of acetylene to prime the community for acetylenotrophic activity.	1
