host-associated	The proximal murine colon contains mucosal folds that are known to be associated with morphologically distinct microbes. To identify these microbes, we utilized the technique of laser capture microdissection to sample microbes associated with these folds (interfold region) and within the central lumen (digesta region). Tag pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes was used to compare microbial populations between interfold and digesta samples.	2
