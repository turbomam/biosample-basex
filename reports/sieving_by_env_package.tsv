soil	one forest plot had the size 25.8 m x 25.8 m with 400 tree individuals planted in 1.29 m distance, at each forest plot four tree individuals of each tree species were randomly selected for sampling, at each sampling tree four soil cores were retrieved at 20-30 cm distance in each direction, all four cores form one composite sample for each sampling tree	394
